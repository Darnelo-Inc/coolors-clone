# Coolors

Coolors is a simple yet useful tool for designers and developers looking for inspiration or organization in their color choices. This GitHub repository contains a project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that generates various colors and saves them for future use.

To use the application, simply open the link: _https://darnelo-inc.github.io/coolors-clone_. New colors can be generated by pressing the spacebar. To lock a color and prevent it from changing, click on the lock icon. The hex code for a color can be copied by clicking directly on the code displayed in the color column.

Multiple hex codes for the colors generated at any given time can be copied directly from the address bar. This feature allows for easy sharing and organization of color schemes.

Thank you for using Coolors!
